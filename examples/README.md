## Examples
This directory contains several Turing machine configurations you can try out.
Simply copy the `wizard.txt` file from the top folder into one of the examples and
drop the example folder onto Wrye Bash.

To launch the Turing machine, right click on the project in Wrye Bash, and click
`Wizard Installer > Manual Wizard`. To skip the message that the manual wizard opens,
launch it via `Wizard Installer > Auto Wizard` instead.
